  tagline: Fast, Practical Defense for Deep Learning
  summary: |
    SHIELD addresses the urgent need for practical defense that can be readily deployed to combat attacks in real-time. It places JPEG compression at the core of our proposed SHIELD defense framework, utilizing its capability to effectively "compress away" such pixel manipulation. 
    
    <ul>
    <li>SHIELD "vaccinates" a model by re-training it with compressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate multiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble defense.</li>
    
    <li>SHIELD adds an additional layer of protection by employing randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an image using random compression levels, making it harder for an adversary to estimate the transformation performed.</li>

    <li>Extensive large-scale experiments using the ImageNet dataset shows that SHIELD eliminates up to 94% of black-box attacks and 98% of gray-box attacks delivered by the recent, strongest attacks, such as Carlini-Wagner's L2 and DeepFool.</li>
    
    <li>SHIELD's novel fortified multi-pronged approach is fast and works without requiring knowledge about the model.</li>
    </ul>

  tagline: 1st Targeted Physical Attack on Faster R-CNN Object Detector
  summary: |
    ShapeShifter is the first targeted physical attack on Faster R-CNN object detector. It generates adversarial stop signs that were consistently mis-detected by Faster R-CNN as the target objects in real drive-by tests, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and other safety-critical computer vision systems.

  summary: |
    SGX module provides an example of privacy-preserving and inference-preventing ML and Adv-ML:

    <ul>
    <li>SGX module loads encrypted trained model and decrypt inside of the SGX. Also, this module accepts encrypted user-input so we can guarantee privacy even user's machine is compromised. </li>    
    <li>SGX module maintains multiple classifiers and randomly selects which classifier should provide result to user. Since the result is non-deterministic, adversary will end-up with contaminated decision boundary while user can get the precision close to average of all classifiers. Since SGX can protect random number K, we can prevent decision boundary inference.</li>    
    <li>We also build a webpage to guide user who wants to learn Intel SGX technology and this will help user to build the first SGX-enabled application step by step. In addition to this, we provide extensive resources for further study of Intel SGX. Please check the following link for detail: (Link: <a href="http://www.sgx101.com/">SGX101</a>)</li>
